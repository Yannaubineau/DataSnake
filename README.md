# DataSnake : Why use pygame when you have lists ?

This is just a toy project I used to train my understanding of lists and numpy, as well as more general concepts of Python.

Both the code and the idea is entirely self-made.
Use the snake.py program if you want to play the game !

## BE CAREFUL : POTENTIAL RISK OF EPILEPSY

The console might flicker as the program clears the last output each time, so be careful playing this game.
